Introduction

In today's complex financial landscape, making investment decisions can be challenging. This project aims to simplify the process by generating personalized investment recommendations for users based on their financial profiles.

Key Features

- Data extraction and normalization from JSON databases.
- Investment analysis and recommendation generation.
- Customizable news articles and user profiles via JSON files.
- Educational tool for Python beginners.
- Flexibility for integration with external APIs (e.g., chatbots, databases).

Getting Started

Before running the project, make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Pandas 1.0+

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

    git clone <repository_url>

Navigate to the project directory:

    cd <project_directory>

Usage

1. Ensure the following files exist in the `data` directory:

   - `user_data.json`: User profiles in JSON format (e.g., name, age, income, investment goals).
   - `investment_news.json`: Investment news articles in JSON format (customize for specific recommendations).
   - `relevant_data.csv`: Relevant data for analysis (e.g., user IDs, investment types, experience).

2. Run the `main.py` script:

    python main.py

3. The script will generate investment recommendations for users based on their profiles and update the `user_data.json` file.

4. You can check the updated profiles and recommendations in the `user_data.json` file.

Customization

### News Articles

You can customize news articles by editing the `investment_news.json` file in the `data` directory. Organize news articles based on user preferences and investment criteria.

### User Profiles

User profiles are stored in the `user_data.json` file. Customize or add new user profiles to test different scenarios.

### Integration

The project's structure allows for integration with external APIs (e.g., Chat GPT or MongoDB). Modify the code to adapt it to your specific integration requirements.
